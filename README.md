# Insta_Bot_Unfollowers

This Code will help you to track down people who don't follow you or have unfollowed you recently on Instagram. 

You'll get to know this when you go to the 'following's' list of person and this application would do this 100s of times in just a few seconds.

It's a fun application to make and also a great way to learn about bot creation and it's usage.



-->Don't use '_pycache_' folder if you are following the below steps:-

Install Python3 and Pip3(comes along with Python installer).

Create a Folder where you want to build the project.

Open VS code(or any editor yo prefer) and Open that created folder.

Open Terminal in the VS code(or Powershell)

Create Virtual Environment on Windows using : virtualenv -p python <virtual_environment_folder_name>

Check if it is actually installed by typing : virtualenv

Install Selenium(used in Browser Automation and in Playback Testing tool) : 
    >pip install selenium

Install Chrome driver(Install the correct version of your Chrome Browser or Chromium)

Now import the files - main.py and secrets.py parallel to the virtual environment folder. (Refer line: 9)
