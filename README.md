# Insta_Bot_Unfollowers


This Code will help you to track down people who don't follow you or have unfollowed you recently on Instagram. 

You'll get to know this when you go to the 'following's' list of person and this application would do this 100s of times in just a few seconds.

It's a fun application to make and also a great way to learn about bot creation and it's usage.
